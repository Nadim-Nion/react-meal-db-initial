# MealDB Order Management Website

---
## Description

Welcome to the MealDB Order Management Website! This project allows users to add their favorite meals to an order list, offering a seamless and interactive dining experience. Key features of this web application include:

## Key Features:

1. **Persistent Order Data:** Unlike many other meal order apps, the data in your order list won't disappear when you reload the webpage. This ensures that you won't lose your carefully curated list of meals, even if you accidentally refresh the page.

2. **Local Storage:** We've implemented local storage to securely save all your order data directly in your browser. This means your order list is available every time you return to the website, making the ordering process more convenient.

3. **Interactive User Experience:** We've designed the website to be highly interactive, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for managing your meal orders. Whether you're adding or removing items, the website responds in real-time to your actions.

We believe that good food should be easy to order, and this MealDB website is here to make your dining experience hassle-free and enjoyable. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use this project as a reference for building your own interactive web applications.

We're excited to have you here and hope you find this project useful and inspiring.

Netlify: 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
